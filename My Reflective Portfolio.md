# My Reflective Report

## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
- Is everything a system?  Why or why not?

Not everything is a system due to the fact that multiple elements or parts may not have a relationship to each other, meaning that they are not a system. However, systems can be found practically everywhere, regardless of whether it is a living thing, a society or a technical construct.
- As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?

A passenger aircraft could qualify as a complex system due to the fact that it functions differently depending on external and internal pressures. The aircraft can be perceived as complex as opposed to complicated since it does not act in the exact same way each time it is used, and its outcome, whilst similar, is not completely predictable.
- Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?

Whilst the passenger aircraft can be perceived as a complex system, it would not qualify as a complex adaptive system, since the aircraft itself does not evolve/adapt itself over time. Also, the characteristics of complex adaptive systems, specifically the distributed control characteristic, do not apply to the aircraft, since it does not behave autonomously.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Following the completion of Module 1, I have gathered a far greater understanding of what a system is, completely eradicating any preconceived notions that I may have taken into the subject. I now understand the fact that systems are a far more intricate concept than previously thoughts, now understanding that a system does not have to be entirely technical or social, and can take a sociotechnical form, incorporating hardware and software, as well as human interaction, which all form relationships in order to complete a task, or various tasks.
### What insights have I gained?
Due to an enhanced understanding of the notion of a system, specifically a complex adaptive system, I have been able to recognise the emergence of such systems in all aspects of society, not just within the IT world. Such systems are being incorporated into businesses, educational institutions and households all across the world. This has allowed me to acknowledge the necessity of the subject, recognising how such systems are crucial in our current climate, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, where such systems are allowing employees and students to continue working without having to directly interact with other people.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The strengths that I have recognised upon the completion of Module 1 is that I have created an organised and structured set of folders and files to assist with my studies throughout the remainder of the subject. I have also installed and set up any software that is required for the subject, despite the fact that I am not at all familiar with such applications/services. However, upon reflecting on such resources, such as Github, Python and Anaconda, I have recognised that with my dedication to the subject, as well as the guidance of the educators, I should be able to understand how such resources will apply to the subject, as well as my career in IT, ultimately contributing to success in such an emerging career.
However, despite these strengths, there are also weaknesses that I have recognised upon reflecting on Module 1, which include the previously mentioned inexperience with such resources which include programming, which has always been an area of IT that I have seemed to struggle with. Also, another observed weakness which should hopefully diminish as the subject progresses is keeping up with the various platforms used to run all subjects this semester in an online and on-campus environment. However, despite not having Canvas prior to this subject, similarly to the other resources, with enough practice and experience, I should be able to adapt and grow more comfortable with the learning environment.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
When reflecting on the first week of the subject, a major challenge which I believed to have stagnated my learning was my inability to find the subject’s textbook, which was said to have been available on the UTS Library website. However, this problem was soon ameliorated when it was announced through email that the textbook was not yet available, and that the subject coordinator had contacted the library about releasing an electronic copy of the book onto the website. However, whilst this problem was resolved, I did not actively contact anyone to find a solution to my problem.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflecting on how I handled the previously mentioned challenge that I encountered, I understand that the next time I face a challenge that may affect my learning, I should immediately contact the subject coordinator, or anyone that can answer any questions that I may have, This is a far more effective and appropriate response to any concerns that I may have, as opposed to simply waiting for an announcement to be made.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflecting on Module 1, the theory that appeared to be the most useful to me as I aspire to have a career in information systems, is the fact that sociotechnical systems rely just as much on the people that develop, maintain and interact with the technology than on the hardware and software itself. This is crucial to understand due to the fact that the system can not be analysed based on individual parts or elements, as it is the relationships between all the parts of a system which allow tasks to be performed and objectives to be met. This is necessary to understand since one who interacts with such systems must have an intricate understanding of all aspects of the system, not just individual elements.



## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
This week, I was able to acknowledge the various uses of models, not only in businesses, but also in everyday life, since models assist with both basic and complex decision making and allow information to be communicated and explored in practically all areas of life. This led into understanding how one model can be applied to many uses, which is vital in systems since it can be made evident that diversity and combinations of ideas allows for a much more concise and accurate understanding of a concept.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Due to the above notions that I learned during the subject’s workshop, I have been able to comprehend how many model thinking uses various approaches and theorems to broaden the ability to collect, analyse and process data, leading to the development of wisdom, which allows appropriate knowledge to be applied to certain scenarios through averaging the results of ‘many models’. This correlates to the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ concept, which argues the importance of variety and how it results in more defined results. Upon reflecting upon such ideas, I have been able to understand how the diversity prediction theorem is in fact a reliable and successful approach, which challenges any preconceived notions that I may have had when thinking about such ideas.
### What insights have I gained?
Upon completing the module’s discussion board activity for this week, I was able to recognise the presence of many model thinking in my workplace, which is a concept that I have not previously recognised. However, upon reflecting on the success of such models in the working environment, I have been able to understand how many models allow for much more appropriate decision making, since without such thinking, many decisions would be uninformed, rushed and would most likely end in failure. Hence, since I have been able to reflect upon how many model thinking is used in different aspects of my life, I am more open to applying it to other predicaments where it would assist in decision making.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout the completion of module 2, as well as module 1, the strengths that I perceive to have been the most evident was my ability to interact with the discussion board activities. This is due to the fact that only a select amount of students have contributed to such activities, allowing me to recognise my commitment to the subject and how I would like to learn more and interact to an even greater extent during the course of this subject. However, weaknesses that I have recognised when reflecting on my contribution to the discussion board for module 2  is my feedback on other people’s responses. This is a weakness due to the fact that I have yet to provide constructive criticisms or debate somebody else’s opinion, which is said to be an important aspect of interacting with the online discussions. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The most significant problem during this week’s workshop was the issues with connectivity. Due to the fact that the household has seen a significant increase of working from home due to the pandemic, the internet limitations has been a constant issue for most subjects. However, it seemed to be significantly worse during this week’s workshop since I dropped out on multiple occasions, missing a few of the significant points stated throughout the tutorial. However, I dealt with this by reading over the provided materials on Canvas, writing detailed notes, prior to the workshop, ensuring that I understand most of the topics before the workshop, using it to further my understanding of such topics and adding to the notes. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting on my approach to the connectivity issues, I realise that it would have been significantly more beneficial to simply ask the teacher to go over the point that I may have missed again, instead of simply passing over it after I drop out of the workshop. This would most likely be the more appropriate scenario since it is necessary that I understand all of the content provided in the workshops, and that the teachers would likely be happy to go over certain topics again and answer any additional questions that I may have for the points that I missed.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I found that the most relevant and useful theory during the module 2 workshop was the idea of ‘more’ being better than ‘less’, in reference to the wisdom of the crowd theory. This is due to the fact that whilst I may believe that my individual ideas are ideal for certain scenarios, it is far more likely that my ideas can be significantly improved upon or replaced entirely if more diversity and variety is considered during problem solving stages of certain situations. Hence, I have been able to recognise that vast amounts of viewpoints, no matter the correctness of individual ideas, are almost always more effective than my individual thoughts.



## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
Following the completion of the module, with a specific focus on people, I have learnt about the behaviours and heuristics that people follow, and how they can be combined in a model to establish innovation, following the basis of the ‘wisdom of the crowd theory’. This has allowed me to recognise how people can fit into a socio-technical complex system, and how certain models, such as signalling models, can be used to depict such behaviours and biases in a way that is easily understood and can be adapted to a certain situation.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Despite the fact that most of the concepts/models introduced in this module were relatively new to me, the most significant idea which I was not previously aware of is the idea of signaling models. I perceive this to be such a necessary concept since it is constantly occurring in all social/sociotechnical systems, whether we recognise it or not. Reflecting on previous group tasks and even just casual conversations, it is fascinating to think about how such signalling is evident in the behaviours of people, and how it influences the value and power that they have in a group.
### What insights have I gained?
The most apparent insight which I encountered following the workshop on this module was the notion of dividing payoffs and costs in groups. This is due to the fact that it caused me to reflect on my contributions to group dynamics and how extensive the impact of me joining or leaving a group would be. Whilst I believe that my contribution to groups is appropriate, this concept has forced me to ensure that signal my strengths and weaknesses to groups in the hopes of increasing my value.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
In reflecting upon the strengths and weaknesses that I have identified this week, it is evident that I am currently on the right path to succeed in the subject, but could significantly increase such successes by altering some behaviours that may be stagnating my progress. The strengths that I have recognised include my ability to focus intently during the workshops, adding to my notes as I hear the lecturer state something that may be important to the subject. However, a significant weakness that has seemed to only just appear this week was being slightly unprepared for the workshop as I had not read all of the module’s content prior to the beginning of the workshop. This is due to the fact that I ran out of time before to the workshop as a result of poor time management.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflecting on this week’s content, I have acknowledged that the focus on the psychology of a person is somewhat of a foreign concept to me, as I have yet to properly analyse/investigate behaviours and heuristics in any other task in my education and life. Hence, following such concepts as one’s heuristics were a significant challenge for me at first. However, upon researching the topic, I was able to understand that heuristics are essentially one’s personal process of completing a task, with an example being the concept of ‘big rocks first’. Hence, this challenge was quite easily ameliorated.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In regards to my struggles with time management this week, I could significantly minimise this issue through manually writing down a schedule of when to finish certain readings/note takings, taking into consideration the times of other subjects’ tutorials and lectures. This would allow me to stick to a certain regime and would diminish the amount of time wasted doing unnecessary tasks.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
As previously stated, after reflecting on this week’s content, I perceived the most relevant theory to be the concepts regarding group behaviours and perspectives, and how signalling models can be used to recognise the ideal scenarios for people to signal certain pieces of information. Through this idea, I was able to recognise how each individual’s biases and heuristics can accumulate in order to more efficiently and effectively solve problems through innovative measures. This is due to the fact that each person’s irrational behaviours provide various perspectives on an issue, thus providing diverse solutions. Hence, I have learnt that I should actively seek diverse opinions and perspectives on how to face a problem in order to solve it in a suitable manner.



## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
This week, I was able to understand the concept of system dynamics models in comparison to agent-based models, recognising how each of these models can be applied in real life scenarios, specifically in predicting the outcome of preventative measures for Covid-19. Upon reflecting on these two models, I was able to further comprehend the necessity of such models in our daily lives due to the fact that they could be implemented into specific scenarios in order to save lives.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflecting on this week’s content, I was able to recognise that the most significant new information to me was potentially the idea of feedback and loops through the causal loop diagrams, which can be used to enhance one’s understanding of a system. This is a vital skill to understand since it can not only help to explain a system to somebody who is unfamiliar with it, but it can also be used to graph the flow of information and identify any possible flaws or errors.
### What insights have I gained?
After reflecting on the video played during the workshop, explaining how the use of system dynamics models to model Covid-19 is ineffective, provided the necessary insight that agent based models is the more appropriate response when simulating a real world predicament with various autonomous agents. Also, as well as being able to recognise that these agent-based models are superior in predicting outcomes for various scenarios, I was also able to understand that they can be used to train the simulated agents and build up significant amounts of knowledge and complexity which was made evident in the agent-based hide and seek video. Reflecting on this video, it is made evident that these models could perhaps act as a replacement for people in various workplaces due to the higher rates of learning as well as the more appropriate solutions to different problems.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Following the completion of week 4, I have been able to recognise my primary strengths to be my ability to consistently take in completely new information and attempt to retain it all with the help of summary notes. This is vital for my future success in this subject since it has been made apparent that I will need to have a basic understanding of a vast array of concepts and theories in order to complete my final assignment. However, a weakness that I have also been able to recognise is confusion with more of the technical side of the concepts presented in the content. Whilst I am able to understand the ideas behind most of the theory, I sometimes tend to struggle with understanding the coding behind models due to my inexperience with programming. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
In regards to my struggles with understanding some of the programming concepts provided in the content, I have attempted to ameliorate this by learning some of the basics of the Python language. However, this was generally unsuccessful since the foundations of Python that I learnt were not able to help me understand some of the code from the different model examples. However, with more learning, I am hoping to understand more about Python since I do acknowledge its relevance in the IT world.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflecting on my approach to this week’s content, despite being mostly successful, I could allow myself more time to prepare for the workshops, taking more extensive notes on the content so that I have an even greater understanding of the different models provided. This would allow for a clearer comprehension of the different ideas and I would hopefully retain more information.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
As previously stated, I personally found the idea of the agent-based models to be the most necessary theory provided this week since it is likely that such models will be necessary in the development of sociotechnical systems in the future. Since they are a one-to-one model of the reality that they are simulating, the agents are represented in a realistic environment, allowing for the analysis and development of interactions between the agents, allowing for a more intricate and accurate representation of an unlimited amount of scenarios. 



## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
When reflecting on week 5, which consisted of learning about aggregating decisions and behaviour, it is made evident that this week’s content is centralised around the notion of understanding and predicting patterns and trends surrounding the characteristics of agents in a system. I have learnt that this can be used to track the lifetimes of certain systems, and predict potentially detrimental outcomes. Hence, I have learnt that through such aggregations, using probability and distributions, we are capable of using logic to comprehend patterns and outcomes in practically any field.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Despite the fact that a lot of the content from this week’s workshop revolves around the same ideas used in my ‘Business Statistics’ class, there was still relevant and new information which we had not yet gone through in the statistics subject. This includes the power laws, or long tailed distributions, which can be used to track objects arriving one after another, allowing for analysis to take place and hence leading to predictions about outcomes and the probability of certain events occurring. Reflecting upon this topic, I have realised how it can be used for various businesses but also to save lives, which is most apparent with the plotting of earthquakes, predicting potential future magnitudes and high-risk locations.
### What insights have I gained?
I have recognised the most valuable insight of this week’s content to have come from the TED Talk from Geoff West, regarding the use of power laws to discover the lifetimes of cities and corporations. Through this video, I have discovered that innovative ideas arising from diversity in a city is what results in the indefinite survival of such communities, also recognising that the lack of such diversity is what hinders the survival of companies in a city. Hence, I have been able to understand how it is vital that I dedicate my strengths towards assisting with this innovation that is so vital for the survival of cities.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week led to the finalisation of our group formation. This led to me recognising significant strengths and weaknesses regarding my approach to the initial stages of our group assignment. My strengths were my ability to create a group chat for our group, ensuring that everyone had been added and began the discussion of who should be our group leader. However, a weakness that I also recognised was that after our group leader had been chosen, we failed to further discuss our approach to the assignment.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Whilst the group seemed to work well together in regards to selecting a group member, we did fail to discuss potential problems to focus on for our assignment. However, whilst we were not entirely successful in beginning our group task, I do have faith that all members of our group will put in a considerable amount of effort into the assignment, as we all seem to be hard workers and motivated to get a good overall grade.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon our group’s initial meeting, I believe that next time I should be more vocal in beginning the conversation regarding the group assignment. I have recognised that doing this would get the group to focus on the task at hand, and would ultimately increase our efficiency and will get us closer to completing the task at a high quality.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflecting on all of the theory we went through in this week’s workshop, I have recognised that the most useful concept from this week was the aggregation of behaviours. This is due to the fact that doing this would allow us to predict the outcomes of certain agents if they stick to their current behaviours or change their behaviours. This can be implemented in various complex systems to understand how certain agents adapt to different environments and also recognise potentially detrimental behaviours which lead to problems in systems.



## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt about the Markov models, and how they are used to measure the evolution of a system over a period of time. Upon reflecting on these processes, specifically the random walks model, I have been able to recognise the significance of such aggregation-based models, and how they can be used to assist in various different business scenarios, such as the analysis of the stock market.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
An aspect of this week’s content that I was not familiar with, but upon reflection have realised it to be a vital concept, is the Granovetter Threshold Theory. This theory declares that individuals have thresholds that, if exceeded, will perform a certain action (or ‘join a riot’). Individuals with low thresholds are more susceptible to rioting even if there is a somewhat low amount of people already rioting, and those with high thresholds are more reserved, and only likely to riot if there is a significant amount of rioters. This notion can be applied to the analysis of buyers in a market, deciding the potential thresholds of customers so that they will pay for a good or service.
### What insights have I gained?
This week I learnt a significant amount about the upcoming assignment that I previously was slightly confused about. Upon reflecting on this week’s content, I was finally able to make the connections between the different models and how multiple models can be applied to the one problem, relating to the idea of many model thinking. This was most evident with the similarities between the SIR Model, which is a contagion-based epidemiological model, and the agent-based model from week 4 which can also be applied to contagious outbreaks. This allowed me to greater understand the usefulness of many model thinking and provides me with the foundations to begin working on the group project.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
After reflecting on my performance in the subject throughout this week, I have recognised my strengths to be the fact that I began the discussion with my group about potential problems to use in our assignment. I created a shared google docs file for everyone to input their ideas, and after each member has expressed their opinion on the path we should take, we can then come together and decide on a final topic so that we can begin working on the pre-submission in week 8. However, a weakness that has also been evident this week is slight confusion over which models I could implement into the assignment with the group’s limited experience with Python.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Whilst only half of the group has provided potential ideas for the assignment so far, all of the group members are active and have stated that they will provide their own ideas within the next few days. Hence, the group seems to be doing well in relation to our interactions with each other.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
The only improvements that I could possibly have made is to set a time limit for all group members to provide assignment ideas. By creating a schedule to complete our group work, it will make the flow of work more efficient and allows us to know exactly when to work on this subject and when we will have time to work on our other subjects. Hence, such a schedule would create a more productive working environment.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I found the theory regarding path dependence to be a necessary concept to understand since it relates to the idea that the probability of an event depends on previous outcomes. This is vital to consider in business since decisions must be made in response to the outcomes of previous decisions. This can involve either recognising the success of past actions, leading to the decision to maintain on a certain path, or it could involve changing the path of a business completely.



## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
Reflecting on the content learnt in week 7, I have been able to gain a much greater understanding of some of the segregation/peer effects based models that we have discussed in previous weeks. This includes a more in depth analysis of Granovetter’s Riot Model, the Standing Ovation Model and Schellings’ Segregation Model. In the workshop, we discussed how such models can be applied to social models in order to understand how certain agents interact with one another, and how their behaviours are altered due to the behaviours of neighbouring agents. These are necessary models for me to understand specifically due to the fact that they may prove to be useful for my group’s assignment, which we have decided to centralise around the Covid-19 pandemic.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In regards to the new content that I learnt this week, the models surrounding coordination and culture provided a unique perspective on the concept of games theory, specifically through the pure coordination games. This notion is significant since it has been made evident that cultures consist of various coordination games with expected payoffs, which ultimately influence the manner in which people interact, potentially leading to either segregation or diversity in a society.
### What insights have I gained?
The most significant insight that I learnt during this week’s workshop was the fact that segregation and riot models can be applied to practically any social situation where a decision has to be made by the individual. This is a crucial insight for the upcoming assignment since it has allowed me to recognise how these models can be applied to people’s willingness to accept a vaccine.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week, following the group’s finalisation of our assignment topic, as well as a list of the potential models we can use for the project, I recognised my strengths in communication as I brought forth the ideas for the task and motivated the group towards beginning the pre-submission task in week 8.  However, my weaknesses from this week arises from my confusion with the replicator dynamics model. I struggled to entirely understand how this model can be applied to a practical situation, and I ultimately struggled to understand the benefits to using this model.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
In regards to my difficulties in understanding the replicator dynamics model, I did not handle it great, since I essentially sat in the workshop attempting to figure out the concept by myself, instead of simply asking for help. This led to me ultimately failing to learn anything from the topic and simply led to more confusion. However, in regards to my team’s responses to any challenges regarding communication with one another was quickly solved as each group member was able to contribute to our group chat and confirm using the Covid-19 pandemic as our assignment topic.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflecting on my approach to any difficulties with the content during the workshops, I have recognised that it is vital for me to ask questions when there is a concept explained that I have had trouble understanding. This would then lead to the tutor perhaps deciding to explain the idea in a different manner which may be more comprehensible and would allow me to better understand the content.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The content that I believe to be the most useful from this week’s lecture was the application of Schelling’s Segregation Model, and how I can model it myself using the NetLogo application. This is useful for the assignment since I can use the code from that website to support my use of the segregation model when measuring the behaviours of a society in response to possible solutions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.



## Week 8
### What have I learnt this week?
This week, I learnt how to utilise the Jupyter Notebook Github extension in order to commit changes to the assignment template and push the changes to the original repository. I learnt this through trial and error when using the application. Also, in reference to the content taught this week, I learnt about two primary examples of the game theory topic of economics. These included the Colonel Blotto game and the Prisoner’s Dilemma. These two theories combine economic decision making with individual’s psychological processes when making such decisions.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflecting on the game theory models, I learnt about the multiple strategies which can be applied to provide the most acceptable game outcomes for the individuals involved. This is most evident with the tit-for-tat strategy in the Prisoner’s Dilemma theory, which ultimately encourages cooperation between the agents involved, using a punishing, but forgiving, method. This is a valuable concept which I was not previously aware of which can be applied to such scenarios as political campaigns, where the parties cooperate with positive ads but defect using negative ads smearing the other’s reputation.
### What insights have I gained?
The primary insight that I learnt from this week’s content was through the application of the Colonel Blotto game in the business world. When taking into consideration job applicants, I was able to comprehend that it is more important to check more boxes than most other applicants than being highly skilled in only a select amount of options. This relates to the notion of having a good understanding of multiple topics being more useful than having extensive knowledge in a limited amount of topics. I can apply this information to my life by recognising that strategy when learning new topics is vital, as I should approach certain scenarios in the manner that would be most beneficial in the future in accordance with the Colonel Blotto game.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Since this week saw our group work on and complete the pre-submission task, it was decided that I would become the group leader due to the fact that I was able to successfully install the required extensions on Jupyter Notebook. Hence, I recognised my strengths in leadership as I delegated tasks among the group members. Also, I was able to recognise strengths in my approach to the creation and submission of the week 8 pre-submission assignment, which was initially very difficult due to my weaknesses with Jupyter Notebook since I have never before used it, and did not entirely understand how it worked.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The primary challenges recognised by our team was our group leader’s struggles with the week 8 pre-submission task. However, even after I became the new group leader, there were still multiple technical problems including the images not showing after I inserted them into the assignment template and also not knowing how to commit changes and push to the repository.  However, through trial and error, I eventually recognised my mistakes and was able to overcome the technical difficulties.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, in order to solve problems in a more efficient manner, I could have asked for help instead of attempting to solve all problems independently. This could have led to the problems being resolved far quicker than they were, leaving me more time to work on the assignment.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I believe that the Colonel Blotto game was the most useful theory provided in this week’s content due to the fact that it can be applied to practically anyone and encourage them to become a more successful individual. This is due to the fact that the theory allows us to recognise that you do not need to be the most skilled in order to succeed at something, and that the ‘underdogs’ can succeed by strategically thinking in your approach to certain situations.



## Week 9
### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflecting on this week, it was a vital stage in regards to the progression of the group assignment due at the end of the semester. This is due to the fact that this week saw the group learning crucial information surrounding the different scenarios that must be analysed for the project. Upon learning about the necessity of these scenarios, we were able to understand that the fundamental purpose of the models is to provide us with different possible outcomes when various scenarios are considered.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
A section of the assignment which I did not truly understand until this week was the implementation of the models using Python code. Previously, I assumed that the code could simply be copied directly from the internet and be instantly applied to our group’s selected problem. However, I now realise that this code must be adjusted in order to relate to our group’s problem which is the spread of Covid-19 and society’s reaction to different preventative measures. This can be accomplished by changing some of the values in the code to meet the requirements of our intended use of the models.
### What insights have I gained?
The primary insights gained during week 9 of the subject was the fact that in order to truly succeed in the assignment, I must grasp a much more comprehensive understanding of Python and how it can be applied to the different models in order to successfully measure the societal behaviours we are hoping to measure.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The strengths that i perceived this week were in relation to my ability to research and form a basic understanding of how Mesa works and how I can apply its models’ code into the assignment and then edit it in order to adapt it to our group’s problem. However, the weaknesses came in the form of my lack of experience with Python. This was made most evident after I implemented Mesa’s code for the Schelling Segregation Model but was unable to run it in the Jupyter Notebook due to an error with the importing of the model code.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
During our group’s meeting to discuss the task during this week’s workshop, we struggled significantly with the questions regarding the scenario analysis. This is due to the fact that the wording of the questions led us to believe that we would need to apply financial methods of analysis to the project, which we were unsure on how to approach. However, after asking Juan for help, we realised that the scenario analysis was basically how the models can be adapted to test various outcomes from multiple possible predicaments. After this problem was resolved, we were able to begin discussing how to approach this section of the assignment.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
If in the future our group encounters any more major or minor issues with the assignment, the two best options would be to search the internet for a solution, or to ask Juan for an explanation on how to approach a certain issue. By doing this, we do not waste time sitting in pure confusion and instead we can aim to resolve the problem as quickly as possible so that we can continue working on the assignment.



## Week 10
### What have I learnt this week?
This week, our group received the feedback provided to us from Group 5. This feedback allowed our group to reflect on the quality of our report. I was able to learn about the structure of the report, and how simple tasks such as including a reference list at the bottom and including more in-text references can significantly improve the report.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Some new things that I was able to learn this week about the way in which Github works was the ‘Issues’ tab. This is a very helpful feature which can not only be used to provide feedback to other groups and receive feedback from other groups, it can also be used to ask Juan for help if needed. New issues can be created if there is a technical error, and Juan can observe the issue and see if he has a solution. This is vital since our group members are relatively inexperienced with Github, Jupyter and Python, so it is helpful that there is an experienced user to guide us as a result of the ‘Issues’ feature.
### What insights have I gained?
The major insights that I have gained throughout this week was the fact that our tutor Juan is willing to assist us if we have any major or minor problems with the technical aspect of the assignment. As previously mentioned, this is advantageous to us due to our lack of experience with the programs used to complete the assignment.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The strengths that I was able to deserve during this week of the subject was centralised primarily on leadership qualities. I was able to constantly update the team about any changes made to the report and told them about how to ask for help using the ‘Issues’ tab. However, some of the weaknesses that I recognised was the group’s inability to find a time where we can all do a meeting to discuss the final sections to complete in the report.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Due to the busy and varying schedules of each of the group members, it was difficult to find one time where the entire group could meet together and discuss which of the final 4 questions each of us would complete over the next few weeks. This was made even more difficult since only two out of the four group members were able to make it to the scheduled  weekly workshop .
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
The scheduling issue could be resolved by simply sending messages that the group can respond to on their own time. This would allow us to get more done immediately instead of waiting for the group to schedule a meeting which is difficult, especially towards the end of the semester. Through these messages, we could assign roles without all of us needing to be present at the one time, and we can sit in a meeting at a later date when it is appropriate for all members.



## Week 11
### What have I learnt this week?
This week, as I furthered my research on the selected models for our group assignment, I have learnt the multiple different ways that the results of the models can be analysed to influence the future decisions made to help resolve a certain issue. This was most evident with the implementation of the Schelling’s Segregation model to the issue of deciding on preventative measures to the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, if the selected preventative measure was mask-wearing, the segregation model can provide us with the outcome of how many individuals in a society would end up being unhappy with their ‘neighbours’ depending on their views on accepting or rejecting the vaccine. This way, we are able to visualise the emotional toll in which the virus has on the members of society, and what would have to occur for all agents to be comfortable with the selected preventative measures.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The most significant thing that I learnt this week that I was not previously aware of was the idea that there are currently extensive amounts of pre-built models available on GitHub, made by professionals that are free to access for all GitHub users. This is advantageous for our group since these models can be used in our projects, or even to serve as an inspiration for the models that we use.
### What insights have I gained?
This week, in the workshop, I learnt more about the application of pre-existing code to a project. I was able to recognise that in many cases, the writing of code from scratch is often far too time-consuming and essentially unnecessary. In fact, the most efficient way to implement code is to take pre-existing code, adapt it to fit your project and then cite the source of the code in the references. This way, the code is far more likely to be accurate and suitable for achieving the desired outcome.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week, as we were assigning each other the remaining questions to complete for the group project, I recognised my strengths as a group leader as we were able to appropriately overcome any disagreements and all come to a unanimous decision by the end of our group meeting. However, I also recognised a weakness during this week’s progression of the group report as I significantly struggled to implement one of the selected Python models into the Jupyter Notebook for the report. However, eventually I recognised that it would be more appropriate to find another more relevant model to implement.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There was a slight difficulty in the initial assigning of roles for the completion of the remaining questions in our group assignment. This challenge arose as a result of each of the members’ inexperience with the Python programming language. Hence, the implementation of the models was the least desirable section to work on for each of the members. However, we were able to respectfully solve this conflict, and ended up assigning two group members to the question. This way, both of the members can help each other with the challenging question, providing more support than if one member was to work on it alone.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Whilst this week was generally successful with the group coming together during our workshop to discuss how we will approach the remaining weeks in order to complete the report to the best of our abilities, one approach to the group work that I would like to change for next week was the number of meetings our group engaged in. I think that it would be advantageous to us if we had more than one meeting per week in order to more effectively resolve any conflicts that may arise during the week, and hopefully complete the assignment to a greater quality.
