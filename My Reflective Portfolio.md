# My Reflective Report

## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
- Is everything a system?  Why or why not?

Not everything is a system is a system due to the fact that multiple elements or parts may not have a relationship to each other, meaning that they are not a system. However, systems can be found practically everywhere, regardless of whether it is a living thing, a society or a technical construct.
- As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?

A passenger aircraft could qualify as a complex system due to the fact that it functions differently depending on external and internal pressures. The aircraft can be perceived as complex as opposed to complicated since it does not act in the exact same way each time it is used, and its outcome, whilst similar, is not completely predictable.
- Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?

Whilst the passenger aircraft can be perceived as a complex system, it would not qualify as a complex adaptive system, since the aircraft itself does not evolve/adapt itself over time. Also, the characteristics of complex adaptive systems, specifically the distributed control characteristic, do not apply to the aircraft, since it does not behave autonomously.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Following the completion of Module 1, I have gathered a far greater understanding of what a system is, completely eradicating any preconceived notions that I may have taken into the subject. I now understand the fact that systems are a far more intricate concept than previously thoughts, now understanding that a system does not have to be entirely technical or social, and can take a sociotechnical form, incorporating hardware and software, as well as human interaction, which all form relationships in order to complete a task, or various tasks.
### What insights have I gained?
Due to an enhanced understanding of the notion of a system, specifically a complex adaptive system, I have been able to recognise the emergence of such systems in all aspects of society, not just within the IT world. Such systems are being incorporated into businesses, educational institutions and households all across the world. This has allowed me to acknowledge the necessity of the subject, recognising how such systems are crucial in our current climate, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, where such systems are allowing employees and students to continue working without having to directly interact with other people.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The strengths that I have recognised upon the completion of Module 1 is that I have created an organised and structured set of folders and files to assist with my studies throughout the remainder of the subject. I have also installed and set up any software that is required for the subject, despite the fact that I am not at all familiar with such applications/services. However, upon reflecting on such resources, such as Github, Python and Anaconda, I have recognised that with my dedication to the subject, as well as the guidance of the educators, I should be able to understand how such resources will apply to the subject, as well as my career in IT, ultimately contributing to success in such an emerging career.
However, despite these strengths, there are also weaknesses that I have recognised upon reflecting on Module 1, which include the previously mentioned inexperience with such resources which include programming, which has always been an area of IT that I have seemed to struggle with. Also, another observed weakness which should hopefully diminish as the subject progresses is keeping up with the various platforms used to run all subjects this semester in an online and on-campus environment. However, despite not having Canvas prior to this subject, similarly to the other resources, with enough practice and experience, I should be able to adapt and grow more comfortable with the learning environment.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
When reflecting on the first week of the subject, a major challenge which I believed to have stagnated my learning was my inability to find the subjectâ€™s textbook, which was said to have been available on the UTS Library website. However, this problem was soon ameliorated when it was announced through email that the textbook was not yet available, and that the subject coordinator had contacted the library about releasing an electronic copy of the book onto the website. However, whilst this problem was resolved, I did not actively contact anyone to find a solution to my problem.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflecting on how I handled the previously mentioned challenge that I encountered, I understand that the next time I face a challenge that may affect my learning, I should immediately contact the subject coordinator, or anyone that can answer any questions that I may have, This is a far more effective and appropriate response to any concerns that I may have, as opposed to simply waiting for an announcement to be made.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflecting on Module 1, the theory that appeared to be the most useful to me as I aspire to have a career in information systems, is the fact that sociotechnical systems rely just as much on the people that develop, maintain and interact with the technology than on the hardware and software itself. This is crucial to understand due to the fact that the system can not be analysed based on individual parts or elements, as it is the relationships between all the parts of a system which allow tasks to be performed and objectives to be met. This is necessary to understand since one who interacts with such systems must have an intricate understanding of all aspects of the system, not just individual elements.
